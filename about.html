  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
I'm legally blind and a hyperpolyglot. Most of the tools, while fantastic and powerful, have nno or very limited screenreader support (assistive technology I use to get around). As such, I built a program that'd help me learn French (language I was learning at the time). I wrote it to be general enough to be easily extendable to other languages. I intend to keep adding languages, and felt I should share it with others who may make good use of it. It's useful for persons with visual disabilities like myself, and the sighted can also benefit from it. I apologize for the abismally bland UI (that's what happens when a blind man designs UI lol). It's hard to maintain and improve the site by myself, and help (in colab to add a feature/language/advise/feedback or a small donation on my ko-fi) is deeply appreciated and goes a LONG way. You can share your feedback <a href="https://forms.gle/VnZjumTrHFuvfD1H6" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
